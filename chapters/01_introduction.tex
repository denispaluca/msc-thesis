\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
In recent years, blockchain technology has gained immense traction, revolutionizing various industries because of its decentralized and transparent nature.
The rapid growth of blockchain technology has brought a new era of decentralized applications, which are made possible by smart contracts.
Smart contracts are one of the key components of most modern blockchain networks.
They are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain and are used to automate the execution of agreements between two or more parties.
As smart contracts handle an increasing set of sensitive transactions, ranging from financial agreements to supply chain management, making them secure has become a top priority.
In the past, we have witnessed several high-profile attacks on smart contracts, which have resulted in the loss of billions of dollars in value.

\chapter{Background and Related Work}\label{chapter:background}
This chapter introduces the technical background and related work for the thesis. It establishes the foundation for the thesis by introducing the concepts of blockchain, smart contracts and specifically smart contracts on the Algorand blockchain network. Furthermore, challenges related to smart contract security and testing are explored, underlining the importance of fuzzing as a relatively novel testing tool in the space. Existing projects in the field of smart contract fuzzing are examined, with the focus on deriving evaluation methods for our own fuzzer.

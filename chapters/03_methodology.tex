\chapter{Methodology / AlgoFuzz}\label{chapter:methodology}
Based on our research on Algorand smart contracts, we decided to develop a property-based fuzzer for Algorand.
As discussed in \ref{section:algorand-smartcontracts}, detecting errors that commonly happen in smart contracts can be better done by a static analyzer.
For this reason, we chose to go the same route as echidna and implement a subset of the features that are present in it. We named the newly developed fuzzing tool \textit{AlgoFuzz}.
In this chapter we discuss our general approach to fuzzing Algorand smart contracts and the implementation details of AlgoFuzz.

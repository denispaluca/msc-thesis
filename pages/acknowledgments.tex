First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Mr. Stephan Lipp for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the course of this thesis. Your advice has been the corner stone of this work.

I would also like to thank Prof. Alexander Pretschner, the TUM Algorand Center of Excellence, and the Algorand Foundation for providing me with the opportunity to work on this thesis.

On a personal note, I would like to thank my family, my parents Ndue and Nikoleta, and my brother Damian.
Thank you for your endless support and encouragement throughout my academic journey.
